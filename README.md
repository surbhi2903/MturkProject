# MturkProject

Design your first HIT using AMT Java SDK. In this project, you will need to use Twitter API to collect data and send your data set (min 100 tweets) that potentially contain any type of religious extremism.

Ask workers to verify if a tweet contains extremism, why (justification), scale of extremism and their confidence score. Design you HIT GUI in a simple and user-friendly manner. For final classification use a consensus of at least three workers.

You can send your HITs to students in the class using AMT Sandbox. Optionally you can publish your HITs for actual crowd workers (paid) for undisclosed bonus points.

Programming language/environment: Amazon Mechanical Turk Java SDK (https://requester.mturk.com/developer).

What to submit: Please post the source code (zip) and a brief description at ELC. Please also post a picture/snapshot of your sample HITs. Also include your data set and responses from the crowd workers.
